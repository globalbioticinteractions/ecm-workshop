3. Be ready to create a new blank [Google Sheet](https://sheets.google.com/) at  [https://sheets.google.com/](https://sheets.google.com/).

Also, if you are interested in actively coding the "big" dataset (>6M records), please make sure that you are ready to go! We are doing a tutorial in R and you can follow along (but it is not required).
