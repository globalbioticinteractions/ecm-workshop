## Objectives

The goal of this exercise is to take the transcriptions and association data interpretations from your individual worksheets and discuss the results with your group to see how interpretations of interaction data can vary between transcribers. Group should discuss and try to come to an agreement for each specimen, record agreed upon terms (or new terms/categories needed) on group worksheet, and appoint spokesperson to share group results with whole class (next last portion of this workshop).

> ## `Exercise 1. Group worksheet & discussion` 
>
> 1. Download a copy of the group activity spreadsheet to fill in, or open and make a copy you can edit in Google Drive or Google Sheets. Appoint one person to record/take notes for the group.
> * [Excel sheet (.xlsx)](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/ecm-workshop/blob/gh-pages/files/2-%20Group%20Transcription%20Interactions%20Worksheet.xlsx?raw=true)
>  * [Comma delimited (.csv)](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/ecm-workshop/blob/gh-pages/files/2-%20Group%20Transcription%20Interactions%20Worksheet%20-%20Sheet1.csv)
>  * [Google Spreadsheet (make copy or download)](https://bit.ly/ECMworksheet2)
> 
> 2. Go over what everyone filled out in each association field and discuss any differences in interpretations or new terms invented. 
> * Do this for each specimen
> * Make sure everyone has a chance to share, voice their opion, and ask questions
> 
> 3. Try to come to a consensus on what association terms should be used and what new terms or fields would be useful additions. 
> * The group recorder should write down agreed upon terms on worksheet or make note that the group could not come to an agreement
> 
> 4. Appoint someone to be the group spokesperson for the larger group discussion (next portion of this workshop).
